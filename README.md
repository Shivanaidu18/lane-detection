Advanced Lane Assistant â€“ Self Driving Car Safety System
A smart web application that detects lane lines, nearby vehicles, and recommends safe lane switches using YOLO and OpenCV, with a live video preview, real-time safety stats, and downloadable output.

ðŸš— Project Description
Advanced Lane Assistant is a Flask-based web app designed to enhance road safety in self-driving cars or driver-assist systems. It:

Detects lane markings in real-time.

Identifies nearby vehicles using YOLOv3.

Calculates vehicle speed using optical flow.

Recommends safe lane changes when current lanes are blocked.

Provides a beautiful, interactive UI with live video streaming, progress bar, and download option.
